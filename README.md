Watch video "Static and the Cat Class"
3) package name: myanimals
   package contents: Animal.java, Cat.java, Dog.java
   Code up everything to create two subclasses (Cat.java and Dog.java) from the Animal class. Note how the static variable numOfAnimals works in your program.
   Create an output statement that outputs the current number of animals objects you have whenever a new Dog or Cat object is created.
   This is how you will know your program is working properly.
